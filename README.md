## Energy Web - JavaScript/TypeScript Developer recruitment task

## How to run 
1. Run tests: `npm t`
   <br/>
2. Testing function with custom inputs in addition to the test cases

 - Run `bash run.sh` in the src/ directory.

You can change the following for your custom test cases:

```
// CUSTOM TESTS: Example to run custom inputs and check the implemenation 

const genres: Genre[] = ["Crime", "Drama", "Music"];
getFilteredMovies({ genres });
```


## Alternative Approaches
1. I have added a more simpler alternative approach - however, this approach assumes that the maximum genres a movie can have is **3**.
